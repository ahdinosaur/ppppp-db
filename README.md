**Work in progress**

## Installation

We're not on npm yet. In your package.json, include this as

```js
"ppppp-db": "github:staltz/ppppp-db"
```

## Usage

It's a secret-stack plugin much like ssb-db2. Other than that, you can also use
the feed format `const FeedV1 = require('ppppp-db/feed-v1')`.
